	"hexbound.book.basics.hexbound_exists.1": "I have found evidence of a different branch of _Hexcasting. Known as Hexbinding, this particular school uses media to create and control automata known as Constructs, manipulate items, and more. As always, I will document my findings in this journal.",
	"hexbound.book.interop.hexal.title": "Hexal-Hexbound",
	"hexbound.book.interop.hexal.1": "It appears some of the _Hexcasting disciplines I've encountered can operate together.$(br2) First, I've discovered that Item Iotas, as created by the likes of Duelist's Purification, and Item Type Iotas, as created by Physician's Purification, are near-identical! Comparisons between them or their types should therefore work as expected.",
	"hexbound.book.interop.hexal.2": "The second and, perhaps, even more important discovery is the ability of Constructs to maintain Links. This will allow me to send iotas between Wisps and Constructs, or even Constructs and myself! The possibilities are well and truly endless.",

	"hexbound.book.constructs.constructs_intro.1": "Constructs are a type of machine used by Hexbinders in ages past, and, following meticulous study of surviving blueprints, are now at my disposal.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.constructs_intro.2": "What puts Constructs apart from simpler machines such as the Golems employed by villages of this world is their ability to process _Hexes and use special patterns to interpret _Hexes as physical actions to perform. While the limitations are many, these ''commands'' allow me to encode a variety of tasks too mundane or dangerous for me to perform as Construct instructions (unless I find myself getting attached to these inanimate objects).",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.constructs_intro.3": "First, the limitations:$(br)$(li)Constructs are too sensitive to use their own _media for casting _Hexes. It should be assumed they do not possess any _media to spend.$(li)Most patterns, especially Spells, directly affecting the outside world simply cannot be processed by their limited pseudo-minds.$(li)Said pseudo-minds behave as any other Figment: Mind's Reflection will push Null, Pigments and Sentinels will not function.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.constructs_intro.4": "Now, for some details about the casting mechanism:$(br)$(li)Construct instructions are a list of Iotas and are executed immediately after each other, not unlike those contained within Casting Items.$(li)Constructs start new instructions with an empty stack and Ravenmind.$(li)Encountering a Mishap or an error in executing the command, cancels both the execution and any issued command, as well as clear the stack and Ravenmind.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.constructs_intro.send": "Some basic patterns to close off the introduction. Remove a reference to a Construct and a list of patterns from the stack and send the list as instructions to the Construct.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.constructs_intro.construct_self": "If executed by a Construct, puts a reference to it on the stack. Otherwise, causes a Mishap. Should be used instead of Mind's Reflection for _Hexes executed by Constructs.",

	"hexbound.book.constructs.executing_commands.1": "The core component of any _Hex executed by a Construct will be its commands, however there is an issue that needs to be addressed first. Construct instructions, like any _Hex packaged into a list, execute instantly after each other. While normally not an issue, this causes multiple commands issued in a row to replace each other, not giving even the shortest ones a moment to be executed.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.executing_commands.2": "The solution lies in the last argument to any command pattern. Once the command has finished, the construct will execute the list passed to it next. Stack and Ravenmind remain intact between these executions, and they can be chained to execute whole sequences of commands. However, each command will bring the spell closer to its execution limit, like Hermes' Gambit would.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.executing_commands.3": "Finally, a few notes on evaluating commands:$(br)$(li)Commands can only be evaluated by a Construct. Doing so myself will cause a Mishap to occur.$(li)Some commands require the Construct be able to perform certain actions like picking up items or harvesting crops. $(li2)Should I, eventually, discover a Construct incapable of such actions, evaluating such a command will cause a Mishap.                      $(li)Some commands require the target be directly next to the Construct. I can expect about two blocks of leeway within which the Construct can figure the details out.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.executing_commands.4": "Should a Mishap or a command error occur, I can examine the Construct by using a Scrying Lens on it while sneaking to find the issue.$(br2)Now, for the commands themselves.",

	"hexbound.book.constructs.executing_commands.pick_up": "Removes an entity representing a dropped item from the stack and instructs the Construct to pick it up. The item must be next to the Construct, the construct must be able to pick items up and not be carrying one already.",

If harvesting the block destroys it, it will be replanted by the Construct. The position must be next to the Construct, and the Construct must be capable of interacting with the world.",

	"hexbound.book.constructs.executing_commands.use/block.more": "If the second vector is not zero, the block is used from the side indicated by it. If it is zero, it will be used from the side closest to the Construct. The position must be next to the Construct, the Construct must be capable of carrying items, and interacting with the world.",

	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.1": "After careful study, experimentation, and filling in both figurative and literal holes in what blueprints I could find, I believe I'm ready to create a Construct of my own.$(br2)Spider Constructs, as I've taken to calling them, are small, but nimble assistants capable of interacting with their surroundings, and carrying items.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.2": "One of the blueprints contained an alternate design for this Construct, which I replicated as best I could. The two designs can be switched by using an Iron Block or Amethyst Block on the Construct while sneaking or, should I find the Spider form not to my taste, by enabling a form of perception filter in configuration files to make all Constructs appear to me as their alternate design.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.core.title": "Spider Construct Core",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.core.desc": "The first of the three components required to create this Construct is the Core, a composite of the lenses, motivators, and inert _media required for the Construct's base form.",

	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.battery.desc": "The battery is the second component. While already made of a fair amount of _media, it will have to be amplified further. Standard usage of Recharge will do, and I will be able to see the amount of $(media)Amethyst Dust$() required on the battery itself.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.3": "Some notes on the final component. The evidence I found clearly shows it is meant to be created artificially, but is not detailed enough to do so.$(br)Fortunately, I managed to work a replacement into the process: a living Allay. A creature well-attuned to _media and already capable of carrying items makes this process almost too easy.$(br2)Sometimes I wonder if the Allay's fate should concern me more than a passing thought.",
	"hexbound.book.constructs.spider_construct.create": "The inputs represent, starting from deepest on the stack, the Allay, a dropped Core, and a dropped fully-charged Battery. The items are consumed, and the Allay is converted into a Construct."
